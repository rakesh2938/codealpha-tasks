Project Overview;
Phishing Awareness Training is a cybersecurity awareness project designed to educate users about phishing attacks, fake websites, and social engineering techniques used by cybercriminals. The goal of this project is to help individuals recognize threats, avoid common traps, and respond safely to suspicious communications.
This repository contains training material suitable for **college assignments, corporate security awareness programs, and internship submissions.

 Objectives;
* Understand what phishing attacks are and how they work
* Learn how to identify phishing emails and fake websites
* Become aware of common social engineering tactics
* Follow best practices to avoid phishing attacks
* Engage learners through real-world examples and quizzes

-->What is Phishing?
Phishing is a cyberattack technique where attackers impersonate trusted entities to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, OTPs, or financial details.
Types of Phishing Attacks
